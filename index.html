    <p class="asid">
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
        Yeah, I was ridin' 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
        I was ridin' 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
        Yeah <br> <br>

        I was riding 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle <br>
        Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel <br>
        When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit<br>
        I been pullin' up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches<br>
        Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)<br>
        Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)<br>
        Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)<br>
        I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm) <br> <br>

        We was lurking on 'em, ain't show no mercy on 'em<br>
        We was goin' back to back, we put a curfew on 'em<br>
        It was dark clouds on us, but that was perfect for us<br>
        We know you always crash and burn, but it was working for us<br>
        Limo tint the V-12, double check the details<br>
        Gotta cross my T's and dot my I's or I can't sleep well<br>
        Millions off of retail
        Once again, I prevail
        Knew that shit was over from the day I dropped my presale<br>
        Hold up, let the beat build<br>
        See me in the streets still<br>
        I been fightin' battles up a steep hill<br>
        They gave my road dog twelve, it was a sweet deal<br>
        And I been ridin' solo tryna rebuild<br>
        Look <br> <br>
        <video width="410" height="325" controls>
            <source src="racks.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        Look, under no condition would you ever catch me slippin'<br>
        Motorcaded shooters plus the Maybach chauffeur driven<br>
        If they catch me wit' it, gon' send me off to prison<br>
        Judge ain't sympathizin', court don't show forgiveness<br>
        Engine in the Lambo' drownin' out the music<br>
        Silk Dior with the flowers, five gold Cubans<br>
        Champagne while I shop, hope I splurge foolish<br>
        Closin' escrow twice this month, both commercial units<br>
        Damn, I wish my nigga Fatts was here<br>
        How you die thirty somethin' after banging all them years?<br>
        Grammy nominated, in the sauna sheddin' tears<br>
        All this money, power, fame and I can't make you reappear<br>
        But I don't wipe 'em though<br>
        We just embrace the only life we know<br>
        If it was me, I would tell you, "Nigga, live your life and grow"<br>
        I'd tell you, "Finish what we started, reach them heights, you know?<br>
        And gas the V-12 to the pipe and smoke" <br> <br>

        Another million dollar bail, that's just some regular shit
        See my granny on a jet, some shit I'll never forget
        Next day we flew to Vegas, with my Puma connects
        We break bread, we ain't new to success
        Bleed music, invest, enterprise, take lucrative steps
        Cold game, but I knew it was chess
        As a youth in the set
        Learn the game, you a student at best
        But it's a couple things you can expect
        Look, just like money know money, nigga, shooters respect other shooters
        We was both, don't want my crew on your neck
        I'm on the freeway in a drop, it got me losing my breath
        I do the dash with the blues on the deck
