                <h1>Nipsey Hussle</h1>
                    <p>Ermias Joseph Asghedom (August 15, 1985 â€“ March 31, 2019), 
                      known professionally as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipsey_Hussle" target="_blank">Nipsey Hussle</a> 
                      (often stylized as Nipsey Hu$$le), was an American rapper and songwriter from Los Angeles, California. <br><br>
                      Emerging from the West Coast hip hop scene in the mid-2000s, Hussle initially became known for his numerous mixtapes, including his Bullets Ain't Got No Name series, The Marathon, The Marathon Continues and Crenshaw, the last of which rapper Jay-Z bought 100 copies of for $100 each.
                      <br> <br>
                      After much delay, his debut studio album Victory Lap was released in February 2018 to critical acclaim and commercial success, and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards in 2019.<br><br>
                      On March 31, 2019, Hussle was fatally shot outside his store, Marathon Clothing, in South Los Angeles. <br><br>
                      Eric Holder, a 29-year-old man who had confronted Hussle earlier in the day, was arrested and charged with murder on April 2, 2019.
                    </p>
                    <p>Ermias Joseph Asghedom was born to Angelique Smith, an African-American woman, and Dawit Asghedom, an Eritrean immigrant on August 15, 1985. 
                        <br><br>
                        He was raised in the Crenshaw neighborhood of South Los Angeles, along with his brother, Samiel, and his sister, Samantha. Asghedom attended Hamilton High School in the nearby Castle Heights neighborhood, but dropped out before graduating. 
                        <br><br>
                        At the age of 14, Asghedom left home and joined the local Rollin 60's Neighborhood Crips, a sub-group of the larger Crips gang primarily based in his home neighborhood of Crenshaw. 
                        <br><br>
                        His stage name, a play on the name of comedian Nipsey Russell, originated as a nickname given to Asghedom by a childhood friend.
                      <br><br>
                      At the age of 19, Asghedom's father took both him and his brother Samiel on a trip to Eritrea, East Africa for three months in 2004. Asghedom credited the trip with inspiring him to become a community activist with an "entrepreneurial spirit".
                      <br><br>
                      Hussle and actress Lauren London began dating in 2013. They had a child together, born on August 31, 2016. London has a child from a previous relationship with fellow rapper Lil Wayne, while Hussle had a daughter, Emani, from a previous relationship. 
                      He remained very involved in South Los Angeles with his businesses, charitable activities, and the homes of family and friends. 
                      The locations for a magazine shoot were in the neighborhood.
                      <br><br>
                      According to police sources, on March 31, 2019, Hussle was shot multiple times in the parking lot of his store, Marathon Clothing, in South Los Angeles at about 3:25 p.m. Hussle was hit five times in the torso and once in the head. Two others were wounded in the shooting.[94][95] All three victims were transported to a hospital, where Hussle was pronounced dead at 3:55 p.m. He was 33 years old.
<br><br>
Police have identified 29-year-old Eric Holder as a suspect. Investigators believe Holder was known to the rapper and that the shooting was possibly motivated by a personal matter. On April 2, 2019, Holder was apprehended by members of the Los Angeles Police Department.

He is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Southern California.
