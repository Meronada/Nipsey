        Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah <br>
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
        Yeah, I was ridin' 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle<br>
        I was ridin' 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle<br>
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
        Yeah <br> <br>

        I was riding 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle <br>
        Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel <br>
        When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit<br>
        I been pullin' up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches<br>
        Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)<br>
        Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)<br>
        Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)<br>
        I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm) <br> <br>

        We was lurking on 'em, ain't show no mercy on 'em<br>
        We was goin' back to back, we put a curfew on 'em<br>
        It was dark clouds on us, but that was perfect for us<br>
        We know you always crash and burn, but it was working for us<br>
        Limo tint the V-12, double check the details<br>
        Gotta cross my T's and dot my I's or I can't sleep well<br>
        Millions off of retail
        Once again, I prevail <br>
        Knew that shit was over from the day I dropped my presale<br>
        Hold up, let the beat build<br>
        See me in the streets still<br>
        I been fightin' battles up a steep hill<br>
        They gave my road dog twelve, it was a sweet deal<br>
        And I been ridin' solo tryna rebuild<br>
        Look <br> <br>

            <source src="racks.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video> <br> <br>
        Look, under no condition would you ever catch me slippin'<br>
        Motorcaded shooters plus the Maybach chauffeur driven<br>
        If they catch me wit' it, gon' send me off to prison<br>
        Judge ain't sympathizin', court don't show forgiveness<br>
        Engine in the Lambo' drownin' out the music<br>
        Silk Dior with the flowers, five gold Cubans<br>
        Champagne while I shop, hope I splurge foolish<br>
        Closin' escrow twice this month, both commercial units<br>
        Damn, I wish my nigga Fatts was here<br>
        How you die thirty somethin' after banging all them years?<br>
        Grammy nominated, in the sauna sheddin' tears<br>
        All this money, power, fame and I can't make you reappear<br>
        But I don't wipe 'em though<br>
        We just embrace the only life we know<br>
        If it was me, I would tell you, "Nigga, live your life and grow"<br>
        I'd tell you, "Finish what we started, reach them heights, you know?<br>
        And gas the V-12 to the pipe and smoke" <br> <br>

        Another million dollar bail, that's just some regular shit<br>
        See my granny on a jet, some shit I'll never forget<br>
        Next day we flew to Vegas, with my Puma connects<br>
        We break bread, we ain't new to success<br>
        Bleed music, invest, enterprise, take lucrative steps<br>
        Cold game, but I knew it was chess<br>
        As a youth in the set<br>
        Learn the game, you a student at best<br>
        But it's a couple things you can expect<br>
        Look, just like money know money, nigga, shooters respect other shooters<br>
        We was both, don't want my crew on your neck<br>
        I'm on the freeway in a drop, it got me losing my breath<br>
        I do the dash with the blues on the deck

      <p>
Almost forgot what I was doing<br>
Almost forgot where I was going <br>
I been driving, I been smoking<br>
Almost forgot what I was doing<br>
Almost forgot what I was drinking<br>
What the hell have I been thinking
<br>
<br>
Rapping for my section <br>
Roll with my protection<br>
Who gon' die next?<br>
Ain't tryna get elected<br>
Riding by myself, time for some reflection<br>
I feel like a young boss nigga that's thankful for his blessings<br>
I can't even lie, I ain't even flexing<br>
Block for me black man, know they tryna stretch us<br>
I ain't tryna preach, I ain't tryna lecture<br>
When you make your first mil' in cash, you gon' feel the pressure<br>
Just wanna feel the thrill<br>
Wanna feel the texture<br>
Wanna feel the drop top breeze<br>
Wanna feel successful<br>
Wanna change the game<br>
Never chase a message<br>
Never stop grinding, cherish no possessions<br>
We ain't get accepted, we're just reinvested<br>
Things that I expected 'cause we ain't even set trip<br>
60th to Megan, choppers for protection<br>
FBI invests us, but they can't arrest us<br>
Almost (almost)
        <br>
        <br>
Now I'm swerving, yeah I'm swerving<br>
Now I'm spluring, yeah I'm splurging<br>
On purpose, on purpose<br>
It's a trip, trip, trip<br>
Turn the headphones up for me G<br>
Little bit lower
<br> <br>
Yeah, always had the passion, nigga this a classic<br>
How we came from nothing, went and got established<br>
Livin' like a savage, tryna make some magic<br>
Everybody stalling, tryna taste the sandwich<br>
I know it's elaborate, a nigga just imagined<br>
Felt the right to ask it<br>
We can make it happen, weaving through the traffic<br>
I can take you back then<br>
Everything I said I meant, I was never cappin'<br>
I was never scared to stand, front line with MAC 10's<br>
Raise and shoot at black men, never felt the satisfaction<br>
When I seen the game collapsing, guess they took the rules and wacked it<br>
Started moving at a different frequency and it got me living lavish<br>
All my partners steady passing, tryna wigle through this madness<br>
Tryna fight this gravity at time and I swear it pull me backwards<br>
Putting thousands on they caskets, tryna pick the right reactions<br>
I appreciate the progress, but I'm so conflict about the status

          <h1>Nipsey Hussle</h1>
              <p>Ermias Joseph Asghedom (August 15, 1985 – March 31, 2019), 
                known professionally as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipsey_Hussle" target="_blank">Nipsey Hussle</a> 
                (often stylized as Nipsey Hu$$le), was an American rapper and songwriter from Los Angeles, California. <br><br>
                Emerging from the West Coast hip hop scene in the mid-2000s, Hussle initially became known for his numerous mixtapes, including his Bullets Ain't Got No Name series, The Marathon, The Marathon Continues and Crenshaw, the last of which rapper Jay-Z bought 100 copies of for $100 each.<br> <br>
                After much delay, his debut studio album Victory Lap was released in February 2018 to critical acclaim and commercial success, and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards in 2019.<br><br>
                On March 31, 2019, Hussle was fatally shot outside his store, Marathon Clothing, in South Los Angeles. <br><br>
                Eric Holder, a 29-year-old man who had confronted Hussle earlier in the day, was arrested and charged with murder on April 2, 2019.
